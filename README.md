# Dominant_color_picker


If you'd like to know which color is predominant in a picture you love, here you have the Dominant Color Picker.

Build by Maria Canals and Ricardo Churi√≥n, using *Nodejs* and *ejs* for the Back, *Boostrap* for the End. We practiced the *pair-programming method using Microsoft teams*. 

You can upload as many images as you want and get their dominant color in RGB format.
Also, you can delete or edit them if you want.

See what you can achieve and upload your fav pictures!
